### Chapter 1: Arrays and Strings

#1.1 Determine if a string has all unique chars
def CH1_1():
    pass

#1.1a What if we can't use add'l data structures
def CH1_1b():
    pass

# 1.2 Given 2 strings, determine if one is a permutation of the other
def CH1_2():
    pass

#1.3 Replace all spaces in a string with "%20" (input: string with addl padding at end to make space for addl chars, true length of string)
def CH1_3():
    pass

#1.4 Given a string, check if it is a permutation of a palindrome
def CH1_4():
    pass

#1.5 Given 2 strings check if they are 0 or 1 edits away (edit = insertion, deletion, replacement of a char)
def CH1_5():
    pass

#1.6 Compress strings like aabcccccaaa -> a2b1c5a3 (if compressed string isn't smaller, just return original)
def CH1_6():
    pass

#1.7 Given an NxN matrix of ints, rotate it 90 deg
def CH1_7():
    pass

#1.7a Can you do it in place?
def CH1_7a():
    pass

#1.8 Given an NxN matrix, if an element is 0 set its entire row and column to 0
def CH1_8():
    pass

#1.9 Assume you have a function isSubstring which checks if one word is a substring of the other. Given two string, check if the second is a rotation of the first
# (waterbottle is a rotation of erbottlewat)
def CH1_9():
    pass
